    make_ext4fs: insert lost+found directory into filled filesystems
    
    Insert a lost+found directory if necessary when creating a filesystem
    based on a directory structure.  This will make the resulting image
    clean when tested with e2fsck, allowing e2fsck to be run on all images
    as a validity test.

    Refactor sparse file support into libsparse
    
    Minimal refactoring of output_file.c into libsparse in preparation
    for completely separating libsparse from ext4_utils.
    
    Moves output_file.c, backed_block.c, and parts of ext4_utils.c
    into libsparse.  The only changes to the remanining files in
    ext4_utils are using the new sparse.h header, and moving the
    wipe call out of output_file.c and into make_ext4fs.c.

    Extend make_ext4fs() to allow callers to pass an selabel_handle for
    labeling files in the ext4 image.  Previously, this was only done
    via the _internal() function.  This extends the library interface
    so that it can be used by the recovery and updater code for labeling
    files from OTA and update packages.

    Extend make_ext4fs with support for looking up the right security context from
    the file_contexts configuration and setting it in the generated image.  This is
    similar to the existing support for looking up the UID/GID/mode via
    android_filesystem_config.h and setting it, but via configuration rather than
    defined in a header.

    Pass file descriptor instead of file name
    
    Passing a file descriptor to make_ext4fs_internal() is more flexible.
    We can use tmpfile() to create a temporary file.
    tmpfile() is better than other solutions because it unlinks the file
    right after creating it, so closing fd effectively removes temp file.
    Thus we don't have to worry about large temp files accidently left
    on the filesystem in case of the program crash.

    Implement poor man's exception handling to prevent errors from killling recovery
    
    make_ext4fs was originally designed to be a standalone program, and the
    error() macro calls exit() after printing a diagnostic.  However, when
    it was turned into a library that recovery links against, calling exit()
    kills the entire recovery process, which the kernel starts back up,
    which dies, and the cycle continues.
    
    This changes make_ext4fs to use setjmp() early, and changes error to
    use longjmp to return to that point.  When longjmp is called, the
    error handler just returns an error.  If it was invoked as a standalone
    program, this causes the program to exit with an error.  If it was
    invoked as a library function, the error return is gracefully handled
    by recovery.

    Also causes factory reset through recovery to do a wipe.

    If you specify a negative length when making a filesystem, then the
